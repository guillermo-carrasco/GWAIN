What is GWAIN?
--------------
GWAIN is a Shoot'em Up game developed in C++ and openGL.

To play GWAIN, just download, compile, and execute it. This code is opensource
and you are free to use and/or change it.

Compiling GWAIN
---------------
A makefile is provided execute the correct g++ command, but you have to care
about installing the required dependencies, which are the following ones:

- Lib ogg
- Lib vorbis
- SDL
- Corona lib (http://corona.sourceforge.net/)
- GLUT
- Lib png
- Lib JPEG

Except Corona lib, for which I have provided the link, all other libraries are
usually available throughout the repositories of almost all linux distributions.

I recommend you to download the development versions of the libraries.

Once all dependencies has been installed, just type "make" in the root directory.

To execute the game, type "./GWAIN", and enjoy!
